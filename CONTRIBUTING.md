# Contributing to dumbBot
dumbBot, other than a Discord bot, welcomes all kind of contributors!

We have a documentation for new contributors, which can be found at [the wiki](https://github.com/damimaa/dumbBot/wiki).

All contributions should be made in accordance with our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# How to contribute
Contributions can be sent via pull requests. If you're new to Git, please check [this guide](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

Pull requests can be made either to the `main` or the `dev` branch. However, unless you're an advanced developer, we recommend using the `main` branch. This is because the `dev` branch could have many bugs, as it's like a beta.

# Improve dumbBot itself
If you have any idea on how to improve dumbBot itself, or want to propose a new command, feel free to open a feature request so we can discuss about it.

Or if you notice any bugs or typos, feel free to fix them!
